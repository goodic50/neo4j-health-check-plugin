# Health Check Plugin for Neo4j

## Neo4j version 4.x

The target database name needs to be specified as a path parameter e.g. */labs/health/neo4j*

Increased the major-minor version numbering to reflect the Neo4j version and follow the APOC scheme.

## Query result

The health check has 4 different results depending from the server's state:

* UP
    * The server is up and running. Also the server has nodes.
    * `{"status":"UP","description":"Neo4j health check was successful."}`
* OUT_OF_SERVICE
    * The server is up and running but it has 0 nodes.
    * `{"status":"OUT_OF_SERVICE","description":"Neo4j has no available nodes!"}`
* DOWN
    * The server is not available.
    * `{"status":"DOWN","description":"Neo4j health check result was invalid!"}`
* OUT_OF_SERVICE
    * An error occurred during the query state.
    * `{"status":"OUT_OF_SERVICE","description":"Neo4j health check failed!","error":"java.lang.NullPointerException: detail"}`
